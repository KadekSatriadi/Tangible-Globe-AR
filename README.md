# Hardware 
- 3D printer or Tangible globe
- Vicon/Qualisys/Optitrack system
- HoloLens 2
- 3D printed components: [Tangible-Globe-AR/tree/main/Sphere-STLs](https://github.com/KadekSatriadi/Tangible-Globe-AR/tree/main/Sphere-STLs)
- Electronic components as per the BOM on [Tangible Globe Assembly Intruction](https://github.com/KadekSatriadi/Tangible-Globe-AR/blob/main/CreatingTangibleGlobe.md)


# Software 

- Broadcast tracking data using Vicon system: [ViconToHololensFilter](https://github.com/KadekSatriadi/Tangible-Globe-AR/tree/main/Software/ViconToHololensFilter)
- HoloLens 2 application of the use cases: [Releases](https://github.com/KadekSatriadi/Tangible-Globe-AR/releases/)

# Acknolwedgement
